# Philosophies

* Build and run as a non-root user
* Build and run from the repository for development work

# Repository layout

The entire project right now is intended to build and run as a normal
user from the repository.

* examples/ example programs of how to use Soapbox
* channel/ root directory for each individual managed Soapbox instance
* src/ main project source code
* contrib/ tools for downloading, compiling and installing other software projects that support Soapbox
* opt/ install location for projects built from contrib
* var/ random files generated by tools when they are run

The contents of src/ is further broken up into more directories so the dependencies for Soapbox users can be
minimized. For instance the website code needs ikiwiki which needs Image::Magick which is a heavy dep. Users
of the publishing code might not need the website code.

The following sub projects exist:

* core/ the common guts of Soapbox
* website/ everything related to creating a static content website with ikiwiki
* publish/ tools for creating media and distributing it to the internet
* broadcast/ tools for live streaming

# Sub-projects

The sub-projects, such as core and website, are standard Perl module projects that function entirely
standalone from the rest of the repository. The sub-projects implement Soapbox while the repository
implements the build, test, validation, and software packaging for distribution.
